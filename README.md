# PersonalTutorPOC
Proof of concept for a personal tutor agent

# Objective 
Leverage a large language model such as ChatGPT or Google's BARD to act as a tutor.

The tutor agent will be confined to a single subject such as photography.
The tutor agent will create a set of topics for the subject.

For example, some topics for the subject of photography will be:
    - Composition - creative topic
    - Lighting - creative topic
    - Lenses - technical topic

The agent will then create reminders to test the knowledge of a previous topic or teach a new topic.
