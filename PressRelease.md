#### Overview

Today at Atlas Inc we are proud to unveil our newest product named Sofia. It is an AI powered personal tutor for developing countries. 
Now anyone can have a personal tutor for any subject they want to learn. For childrens we offer a wide variety of creative topics such as photography, origami, or Kirigami.
For our older user base we offer a wide variety of technical topics such as programming, cooking, or project management. 

The personal tutor will even make flashcards for users so, our customers can easily refresh their memory on topics they have already mastered. For our younger audience members it is a way for them to easily practice while they are mastering the topic of choice.

As of 2025, we have partnered with [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) so; successful completion of each topic will enable a NFT for the user that they can trade.

When we started Atlas Inc our founder had a vision to democratize education, so everyone from young to old, rich to poor can learn anything they want at any time for free. 
We initially started out as a flash cards app insipired by Duolingo, Chegg, and Khan Academy. With the rise of LLM model at 2023 the founding team decided to build a generative AI engine to seed Atlas' current product called Sofia.
