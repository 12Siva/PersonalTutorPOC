#### Abstract

Atlas Inc started off as a simple platform for artists to create and colloborate on AR stickers in the 1980s, born out a failed proprietary trading firm established in the early 1920s called Random Capitol Inc. The company was founded by 5 friends who were laid off during the tech crisis of the early 2000s. The founders were inspired by the custom t-shirts company Vistaprint, to extend the platform for business cards. They wanted to be able to share business cards seamlessly since one of the founders was a slight germophobic. After the Covid-19 crisis of 2019-2021. The platform and the companion app found moderate success by finding a niche market at music festivals. Initally inteded to share business cards with digital wallets. The founders found that the users were using the platform to digitilize home-made pins so, they can be shared and traded! The music festival go-ers thought that it was a more hygenic way to share businesses that they have started themselves. 

The co-founders quickly retrained their ML model to optimize for pins. Taking in a lot of training data from stickers, pins, and business cards. Leveraging state of the art transfer learning techniques and open source LLMs and GANs they were able to train a custom new ML model called Ulysses that was able that was optimal for music festival go-ers to easily exchange business information. It also addressed the environmental concerns that started in the early 2020s; by saving trees. Finding moderate success in the  asian markets where personal hygiene and business customs are highly respected the company reached a revenues of 10 million dollars and become profitable for the 1st time in 2005. 

After the great financial crisis of 2008 - 2009 the company's hopes of an IPO were dashed, so the company decided to scale vertically starting in the Latin American markets. Aiming to become profitable after signficant losses in the order of billions and a negative EPS of $2.56 in the asian business card market the founders decided to pivot the business model into a vertical slice of the education market. Based on the advice of Scott Galloway a NYU professor in marketing and co-host of the successful podcast Pivot. Leveraging their existing business cards and lapel pins AI engine.

With the hope of becoming succesful one of the founders decided to make the AI engine more attractive to customers by leveraging NFTs during the second crypto-currency boom of 2021. They leveraged the ETH blockchain and SOL blockchains to enable a flash card system into the AI engine via smart contracts.
